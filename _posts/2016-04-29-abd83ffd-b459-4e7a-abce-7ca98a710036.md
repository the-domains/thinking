This is Buddha our St. Bernard standing majestically in the snow covered field behind our house in the country.

The serenity of living in the country - away from the big city lights is for me inspiring.

Having traveled the world building conferences, interviewing thought leaders in design and business, mentoring and building strategies in content, customer experience, speaking, and more it is so nice to be home.

To not just be in a house but to live in a place that truly feels like home.
