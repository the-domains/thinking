> "I will not go quietly into that goodnight but I will rage against the dying of the light!"

I've mentored many business leaders and junior designers around the world over the past decade; in the neighbourhood of 100 in total. One of the greatest concerns people continue to have today is around failing. Yet that is how we learn, by failing. 

It makes sense when we pull back from the emotion and look at this logically. Humans, at a biological level, are social creatures. We feel valued when we are given praise for our efforts and our ideas. Yet criticism or even the most modest of critiques that are intended to help one improve, are perceived as harsh and unfounded. 

It is because of this we have stopped debating. We argue. We rage against those who don't believe what we believe. This is a phenomenal opportunity to learn and stretch our imagination of what is possible. Yet because we are in such fear of being wrong or not "succeeding" many simply give up. Which is even more gut wrenching when you consider most don't look at success beyond anything other than their bank account.

A junior designer in Europe heard a talk I gave in Warsaw two years ago about [Accountability in Design][0]. She was thrilled to finally hear a thought leader discuss issues of responsibility, legitimacy, and courage in an era where she didn't feel like her peers were being heard or respected by those in charge. To which I told her we all have to be accountable. Where you see their failures, you too must accept responsibility for your approach and capacity to facilitate value from your point of view to their lack of experience in your field.

We ultimately have two choices. We can go quietly into that good night, as Dillon Thomas once suggested, or we can "rage against the dying of the light." The philosophical metaphor of course being we can chose to sit back and watch the rest of the world, or we can dive in and try to create change and inspire others.

Perhaps if we begin to encourage others to be comfortable in saying simply and plainly, "I don't know" we can create the opportunity to build a stronger sense of collaboration and a higher level of thinking.
