# There are no original ideas

If there are no original ideas - as we now live in a world where we all have access to the same information - then why do we continue profess expertise?

Yet at the same time there is a constant decline in thinking about how to solve problems and find solutions. This is confusing. How are we not continuing to advance thinking and by extension how are we not debate by ideas at an intellectual - and by extension- factual point of view?

Is technology making us lazy? Are we disconnecting from each other at a rate that we no longer wish to connect and learn from others?

Innovation throughout history has only evolved through the colliding of ideas through various disciplines and perspectives - not from a singular community or se of defined perspectives.
